msgid "MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a protocol proposed by IBM and Eurotech. The introduction in `MQTT Official Website <http://mqtt.org/>`__: MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/”Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. We can say MQTT is a protocol designed for IoT. MQTT is based on TCP/IP and transmits/receives data via publish/subscribe. Please refer to the figure below:"

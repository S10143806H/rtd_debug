msgid "SPI is a fast and robust communication protocol that are commonly found on many microcontrollers and is often used to retrieve sensor data or output image signal to a display. Ameba support SPI in both master and slave mode. Here we are going to see an example demonstrating how ameba receive data in slave mode on MicroPython."
